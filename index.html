      <h1>Analyzing the Recent Increase in Book Bans in Schools</h1>
      <h4>Caitlin, Deepak, & Jiwon</h4>
      <p>
        The last several months have seen a rapid, unprecedented increase in the
        ban of books across the United States. This recent banning has been
        known to target and censor books by or about people of underrepresented
        communities such as the LGBTQ+ community and people of color, but there
        have not been many extensive visualizations that shed light on the
        significant impact of book bans in more detail. More information
        regarding this issue can be found here.

      <h4>Where do book bans in the US occur the most? </h4>
      <p>
        Here, we map the absolute frequency of book bans per state and also 
        examine distribution of bans over specific school districts in each state.
