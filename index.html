        The last several months have seen a rapid, unprecedented increase in
        the ban of books across the United States. This recent banning has been
        known to target and censor books by or about people of underrepresented
        communities such as the LGBTQ+ community and people of color, but there
        have not been many extensive visualizations that shed light on the
        significant impact of book bans in more detail. In order to contribute
        further insight on this issue, we analyzed and visualized PEN America's
        dataset that covers all instances of book bans during this recent
        increase in bans from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022.

          First, let's start with an overview of what the recent spur in bans have looked like from month to month.
          The visualization below is an interactive timeline of the past several months that show the top 10 states
          with the highest number of bans. You can click the “Play” button to animate the changes from month to
          month, or you can click on any of the months on the slider manually. You can also switch between the bar
          graph from showing the number of bans occurring in each individual month (i.e. non-cumulative) or the
          cumulative number of bans from July 2021. Play around with the visualization to see if there are any
          particularly interesting findings.

          A couple of spikes in certain states that stand out — in August of 2021,
          there was a big spike in the number of books banned in Pennsylvania.
          This spike made news, which revealed that this book ban targeted black
          and Latinx authors specifically. Another huge spike followed in December
          of 2021 in Texas, where school districts began a massive banning on
          books related to race and sexuality. In February of 2022, Tennessee then
          follows suit in the nation-wide spur with a large spike of its own,
          banning “obscene” books on race and gender. Florida, another leading
          state in the book bans, seems to have relatively consistent and frequent
          jumps in bans from month to month starting from November 2021. Notably,
          these big spikes have occurred in mostly right-leaning states. More
          information and news regarding these specific spikes in bans can be
          found below:

        <p>
          This leads to the question of, where specifically in these states are we seeing these spikes?
          Are there particularly school districts within these states that are dominating the bans?

          To get an initial sense of what kinds of books are being banned, let's take a look at their

        <div id="topTenBarChart"> (bar graph here) </div>
        <p>
          This simple overview already conveys a lot about what kinds of books are being targeted.
          One can reasonably infer that top two most banned titles, "Gender Queer: A Memoir" and
          "All Boys Aren't Blue" are about or have themes of queerness and sexual orientation.
          Looking at number 7, "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian", also reveals that
          themes of indigenous culture and Native American authors have been targeted as well. To
          go into more detail, let's take a closer look at the most commonly shared words across
          the titles of all of the banned books.
        </p>
        <h5>What words are shared most across titles?</h5>
        <p>
          Below is a word cloud of the most commonly occurring words in the titles of the banned books.
          The size of the word correlates to its frequency, and clicking on a word will reveal all of
          the books with that word in its title. Hovering over a listed book title will show the
          districts in which that book is banned. Play around with this visualization to explore how the
          words in this cloud are connected to certain book titles and/or districts.

        <p>
          There is a lot to be revealed here. This word cloud makes very clear what kinds of
          books are being targeted by these bans. With the words “girl” and “boy” being the
          two most prominent, it seems as though school districts care most about making sure
          their kids conform to outdated gender norms and are not exposed to ideas of
          queerness or sexual orientation. This is further compounded by the words “sex”,
          “gender”, “identity”, and even “guide” being among the most common words — when you
          click on the word “guide” to show the titles with the word in it, it shows that
          many of the books are guides for navigating things like sexual identity and
          orientation, queerness, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important observation is that among the most common words are “white” and
          “black”. It is made quite clear these school districts care more about white authors and
          protecting their image of whiteness than supporting black authors. The titles of the banned
          books with the word “white” hint toward their books being about criticism of whiteness and
          racial divide, while the titles of the books with “black” are related to the black
          American experience and uplifting the marginalized voices of the community. It is certainly
          no longer a coincidence that the states that are leading the charge in these book bannings are
          and have been known to be very much right-leaning.
